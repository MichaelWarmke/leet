# Permutations

    decision tree with element that is used is removed from candidate pool

# Combinations 
    
    decision tree with element that is used stays in the candidate pool

    removing duplicates from the output, candidate need to be sorted
    when going down the ride side of the tree, choosing to not include a number means any of those numbers
    so we inc i until the index is no longer on that value
    

# Subsets

    decision tree where you choose to include an element or not

# Backtracking vs DFS

    DFS is backtracking, but when the backtracking occurs at every leaf node
    
    backtracking can occur before it would hit a leaf node, thus having the tree call a pruned tree
    or each branch was not fully taken to it natural leaf node
