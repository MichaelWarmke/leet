# Clone Graph

seems like we can do a BF traversal or a DF traversal

doing this all recursively 

---
Split approach

traverse the existing tree and create nodes and put them into a hashmap originalNode by newNode

then forEach key in that map connect the nodes

---

we can integrate the two above loops into one recursive algo
