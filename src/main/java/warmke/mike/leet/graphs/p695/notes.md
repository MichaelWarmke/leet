# Max Area of Island

similar to p200

forEach node in the grid run DFS to find all the nodes in the island

add each node visited by DFS into a visited set

once all the islands are found, reduce map the lists to size and return the max  

Time Complexity O(m x n) of the area of the grid

same for memory complexity
