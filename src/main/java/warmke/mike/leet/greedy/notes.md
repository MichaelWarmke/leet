# greedy algos

choose the locally optimum solution, and iteratively add all of those together in hopes to get to over all optimum solution

you would choose to use a greedy algo when you have a decision tree, and for some reason you only have to take one of those paths

you would choose the branch that you think is going to give you the best result

this is very close to BFS, or even backtracking where you would only evaluate one branch of a BFS 

these need to two properties

* 1 global optimum can be concluded by selecting local optimum
* 2 optimal solution to problem contains an optimal solution to sub problems

Greedy vs DP

this is similar to DP but DP is exhaustive and considers all branches
greedy "skips" branches like DP but it does so by completely ignore those subbranches
